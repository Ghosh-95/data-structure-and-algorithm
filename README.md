# Data Structures and Algorithm

## JavaScript 🧑‍💻

>Big O notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms. It calculates the time taken to run an algorithm as the input grows. In other words it calculates the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm. It is described as O(x), where x is number of tries in worse-case scenario. It vary for different algorithms.

1. `Linear Search`: Linear search is a type of searching algorithm that searchs from beginning to end of an array. It checks each and every item of the array to check if it matches with the target element. Time complexity of this type of algorithm is `O(n)`.

2. `Binary Search`: Binary search is a searching algorithm, it divides the array into two and searches the target value in one part. It is more efficent than Linear Search while searching on a large array. Time complexity of this type of algorithm is `O(log n)`.
